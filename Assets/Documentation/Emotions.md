# Emotions

The Emotions scene demonstrates how a characters animations can be influenced by their emotional state. For a quick introduction see https://youtu.be/HnFmDeWkzNQ

Note that, at the time of writing we do not have enough animations to show off the emotional animatons. Therefore all that you can see at the moment is the demo UI for controlling emotions and the output that this has for animation controller parameters.

You can download free animations from Mixamo or use any other animations you have available, simply override the included demo animation controller and add your animations to it.

We look forward to your contribution of animatios that will demonstrate this functionality out of the box.
