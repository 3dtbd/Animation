# Animation
Animation controllers, Animations and Scripts relating to animation.

I am not an animator. The animations in here are not, at least right now, very good. However, this is a useful library for use in other 
open source projects that need animations and controllers in demo scenes. While not pretty it does enable open source projects to work
out of the box. Help us make this package truly useful by contributing.

If you know of a source of decent open source animations let us.
